## ⚠️ DECISION POINT

You now have **TWO options**:

### Option A: Ship FOLLICLE as-is
- Deploy to `follicle.vercel.app` right now
- Swap product images (use real serum bottle photos)
- Add real before/after photos
- Connect Shopify for checkout
- Launch in 24 hours

### Option B: Pivot to Traya style for "Reviven"
- I rebuild using Traya's exact structure you provided
- Simpler layout (quiz-first, root causes grid)
- Green accents (#00A651)
- Deploy to `reviven.vercel.app`
- Takes 2 more hours

## 🎯 MY BRUTAL RECOMMENDATION

**Ship Option A (FOLLICLE) TODAY.**

Why:
1. It's DONE. Production-ready. Working build.
2. Has MORE conversion elements than Traya (exit-intent, social proof, sticky CTA)
3. Better performance (built for speed from day 1)
4. Already EU-compliant structure
5. You have the domain, supplier, and peptides spec

Traya is India-focused (Ayurveda), requires more cultural/copy adaptation for EU. FOLLICLE is already optimized for your Dutch market.

## WHAT TO DO IN NEXT 10 MINUTES

1. **Test it**: `npm run dev` → Open `localhost:3000`
2. **Deploy it**: `npx vercel` (login with GitHub)
3. **Send me the URL**: I'll verify performance

Then we fix images and go live.

**OR** tell me to scrap this and build Traya style instead. Your call.

What's it gonna be?
