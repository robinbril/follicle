Award-Winning Hero Redesign
Transform the hero into an ultra-premium, award-winning design that WOWs visitors while converting effectively without scammy tactics.

Design Philosophy
Based on Alex Hormozi Value Equation and premium beauty brand aesthetics:

Dream Outcome: Stop haaruitval (clear, specific)
Perceived Likelihood: Trustpilot 4.8 + 24 studies + 180-day guarantee
Time Delay: 90 days (specific timeframe)
Effort: Simple CTA "Start je behandeling"
IMPORTANT

NO scam elements: No fake urgency, no countdown timers, no manipulative tactics.

Proposed Changes
[MODIFY] 
hero.tsx
1. Premium Background Layers

Multi-layer mesh gradient with copper accents
Soft vignette around edges for depth
2. Product Presentation (Mobile)

Enlarge from w-56 → w-72 (massive visual impact)
Add animated copper orb behind product (slow pulse)
Add floating animation (gentle up/down 8px over 5s)
Dramatic drop shadow for depth
3. Typography Enhancement

Headline: text-[2.5rem] font-black (mobile), text-6xl (desktop)
Bolder weight, tighter leading
Subheadline: More subtle, sophisticated
4. CTA Button Evolution

Height: h-16 (larger)
Rounded: rounded-full (premium)
Shadow: Copper glow hover effect
Scale: hover:scale-[1.02]
5. Trustpilot Integration

Keep elegant, more integrated positioning
Verification Plan
Visual Check
First impression must be "WOW" within 0.5 seconds
Product should command 50-60% of mobile viewport
Animations should feel smooth, not distracting
Conversion Check
CTA clearly visible above fold
Value proposition immediately understandable
Trust elements present but not overwhelming
